#Real Estate Price Prediction using Machine Learning
Project Overview
This project aims to create a machine learning model for predicting real estate prices in Bangalore, India. The project is driven by the belief that everyone should get exactly what they pay for in the real estate market. Overvaluation and undervaluation of properties have always been issues, leading to confusion and unfair practices. To address this problem, we turn to machine learning.

Motivation
Challenges in Real Estate Pricing: Overvaluation and undervaluation in housing markets have always been issues, and there is a lack of proper detection measures.

The Power of Machine Learning: By training a machine learning model with hundreds and thousands of real estate data points, we aim to develop a solution that can accurately predict property prices.

Advantages
Empowering Home Buyers: Predicting house prices helps individuals planning to buy a house understand the price range in the future. This empowers them to make informed financial decisions and plan their finances effectively.

Benefiting Property Investors: House price predictions are invaluable for property investors, allowing them to gain insights into the trend of housing prices in a particular location. This insight aids in making strategic investment decisions.

Problem Definition
Manual Estimation Challenges: It is difficult to estimate the price of a property by manually calculating the affecting parameters required for estimating the property's rate.

Potential for Deception: Customers relying solely on real estate agents may be at risk of paying higher prices than the actual market value, leading to potential deception.

Budget Constraints: Individuals with a specific budget for buying a home may face challenges due to differences in prices provided by agents.

Confusion in Manual Estimations: Relying on manual knowledge can lead to confusion, as data may vary from person to person.

Project Objectives
Automated Pricing Model: We aim to create an automated model using machine learning to provide efficient and accurate property price predictions as per user requirements.
Sample Data
The sample dataset used in this README consists of a single real estate property entry:
area_type	availability	location	size	society	total_sqft	bath	balcony	price
Super built-up Area	19-Dec	Electronic City Phase II	2 BHK	Coomee	1056	2.0	1.0	39.07
Please note that in a real-world scenario, the dataset would contain multiple entries with various properties.

Project Steps :-

1.Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Acquire a comprehensive dataset containing real estate property information, 
including features such as area_type, availability, location, size, society, total_sqft, bath, balcony, and price.

2.Data Exploration and Visualization:
Explore the dataset to gain insights into relationships between features and house prices, using data visualization techniques.

3.Feature Selection:
Identify the most relevant features for the price prediction model.

4.Model Selection:
Choose an appropriate machine learning model for regression tasks, starting with linear regression and exploring more advanced models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.

5.Data Splitting:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

6.Model Training:
Train the chosen model(s) using the training data.

7.Model Evaluation:
Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on the test data.

8.Hyperparameter Tuning :
Optimize model performance through hyperparameter tuning.

9.Deployment:
Deploy the model to make predictions on new real estate data.

10.Monitoring and Maintenance:
Implement a plan for periodic updates to adapt to changing real estate market conditions.

How to Use the Project (with Real Data)
1.Acquire a comprehensive real estate dataset containing multiple property entries with various features.
2.Replace the sample data in the code with your real dataset.
3.Install the necessary Python libraries listed in the requirements.txt file.
4.Run the Jupyter notebooks provided to explore, preprocess, train, and evaluate the machine learning models.

Ethical Considerations
Be mindful of ethical considerations, such as bias in data or model predictions, and take steps to address them.
Legal Compliance
Ensure that you comply with legal regulations related to real estate data and predictions in your region.
